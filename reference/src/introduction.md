## Rust's Unsafe Code Guidelines Reference

This document is a past effort by the [UCG WG][ucg_wg] to provide a "guide" for
writing unsafe code that "recommends" what kinds of things unsafe code can and
cannot do, and that documents which guarantees unsafe code may rely on. It is
largely abandoned right now. However, the [glossary](glossary.md) is actively
maintained.

Unless stated otherwise, the information in the guide is mostly a
"recommendation" and still subject to change.
